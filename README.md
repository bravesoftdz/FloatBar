# FloatBar

**Floating Toolbar by Jerry Dodge, mimicing that of TeamViewer**

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This project is in extremely raw beginning stages and is nowhere close to being usable. At the time of publishing the code to this repository, it is not even really functional. The only reason I'm publishing the code at all is because of multiple requests for it, despite its current state.

The biggest problem I have is my lack of experience in drawing non-client areas, as well as making it automatically center within its parent form. 

## Features

  - Container floating at top of form
  - Collapsed property to hide/show toolbar
  - Tab button to show/hide toolbar
  - Automatically positioning in top-center

## Future

  - GDI+ graphics
  - Smooth expand/collapse animation
  - Auto-size to fit contents
  - Built-in menus
  - Multiple buttons in tab area
